# IntWars-Launcher
A launcher under construction for project IntWars!
# Basics
For now it only supports change of name, champ, skin and rank!
# Comming pretty soon
In the next few days i will add support for opening a server allowing other players to join through IP address.
# .Bat files
For now it still works with .bat files created by the project owners. However i intend to support true launch removing them.
